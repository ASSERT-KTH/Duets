The framework simplifies the configuration of WebDrivers by providing a facade called a Browser, and LocalBrowserBuilder, RemoteBrowserBuilder for easily creating Browsers. Also provides a Page abstraction for modeling web pages of your webapp for testing. This provides an object-oriented approach to testing a web app, where the basic building blocks are SubPages (i.e. re-usable components of a web page)  and TopLevelPages (i.e. a web page at a specific URI).","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jivesoftware/jive-selenium-pages-framework","created_at":"2014-08-14T21:25:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T18:38:34Z","pushed_at":"2016-04-11T17:54:04Z","homepage":"","size":445,"stargazers_count":18,"watchers_count":18,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":true,"forks_count":21,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"open_issues_count":0,"forks":21,"open_issues":0,"watchers":18,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"temp_clone_token":"","organization":{"login":"jivesoftware","id":295243,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5NTI0Mw==","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jivesoftware","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"network_count":21,"subscribers_count":48}
