All connections are made using a secure shell and there is no agent software to install on the remote server. You can monitor Linux servers from Windows, Mac or Linux clients. The system is ideal for monitoring headless servers.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dbothwell/remote-linux-monitor","created_at":"2015-03-17T00:14:26Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T00:07:36Z","pushed_at":"2020-03-27T00:07:33Z","homepage":"","size":807,"stargazers_count":16,"watchers_count":16,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false,"forks_count":5,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"open_issues_count":7,"forks":5,"open_issues":7,"watchers":16,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"temp_clone_token":"","network_count":5,"subscribers_count":2}
