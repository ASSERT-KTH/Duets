The obtained DOM tree may be then serialized to a HTML file or further processed. A command-line utility for converting the PDF documents to HTML is included in the distribution package. Pdf2Dom may be also used as an independent Java library with a standard DOM interface for your DOM-based applications or as an alternative parser for the CSSBox rendering engine in order to add the PDF processing capability to CSSBox.  Pdf2Dom is based on the Apache PDFBoxâ„¢ library.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/radkovo/Pdf2Dom","created_at":"2014-01-13T15:06:23Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T06:06:34Z","pushed_at":"2020-03-24T21:29:52Z","homepage":"http://cssbox.sourceforge.net/pdf2dom/","size":13862,"stargazers_count":120,"watchers_count":120,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"forks_count":53,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"open_issues_count":12,"license":{"key":"lgpl-3.0","name":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0","spdx_id":"LGPL-3.0","url":"https://api.github.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0","node_id":"MDc6TGljZW5zZTEy"},"forks":53,"open_issues":12,"watchers":120,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"temp_clone_token":"","network_count":53,"subscribers_count":19}
