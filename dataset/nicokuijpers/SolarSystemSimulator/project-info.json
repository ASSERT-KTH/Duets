Positions and velocities of 30 solar system bodies and 3 spacecraft are continuously updated using either Newton mechanics or General Relativity. Initial positions and velocities are obtained from Nasa JPL's ephemerides. While simulating, both simulated positions and ephemeris data are visualised for comparison.
