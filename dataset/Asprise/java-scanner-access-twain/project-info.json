Further more, you can rest assured that the SDK is fully compliant with various government privacy acts such as HIPPA and HITECH. High speed ADF scanning allows the end user to scan multiple pages into a ultra small size multi-page TIFF or PDF file. New customers should select this SDK instead of JTwain for compatibility and future proof.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Asprise/java-scanner-access-twain","created_at":"2015-12-11T02:28:55Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T15:51:56Z","pushed_at":"2015-12-11T04:08:51Z","homepage":"http://asprise.com/document-scanner-image-pdf/java-scanning-api-overview.html","size":94,"stargazers_count":28,"watchers_count":28,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"forks_count":16,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"open_issues_count":1,"license":{"key":"agpl-3.0","name":"GNU Affero General Public License v3.0","spdx_id":"AGPL-3.0","url":"https://api.github.com/licenses/agpl-3.0","node_id":"MDc6TGljZW5zZTE="},"forks":16,"open_issues":1,"watchers":28,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"temp_clone_token":"","network_count":16,"subscribers_count":5}
