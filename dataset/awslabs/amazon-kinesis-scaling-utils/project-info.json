You can also simply scale to an exact number of Shards. There is no requirement for you to manage the allocation of the keyspace to Shards when using this API, as it is done automatically.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-scaling-utils","created_at":"2014-10-22T07:32:12Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T12:17:47Z","pushed_at":"2020-06-25T12:23:39Z","size":165967,"stargazers_count":299,"watchers_count":299,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false,"forks_count":76,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"open_issues_count":10,"license":{"key":"apache-2.0","name":"Apache License 2.0","spdx_id":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://api.github.com/licenses/apache-2.0","node_id":"MDc6TGljZW5zZTI="},"forks":76,"open_issues":10,"watchers":299,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"temp_clone_token":"","organization":{"login":"awslabs","id":3299148,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMyOTkxNDg=","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awslabs","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"network_count":76,"subscribers_count":44}
