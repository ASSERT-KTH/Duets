The application needs a GPS fix in order \tto mark an area as explored as the accuracy from the other location sources is not good enough. Currently the minimum accuracy needed \tfor saving the explored area is set at 100 m (600 feet). The accuracy is displayed as a disc around the current position. \tUmbra saves your exploration in an internal database (nothing is sent over the network).
