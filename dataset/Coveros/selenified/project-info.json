Selenified provides traceable reporting for both web and API testing, wraps and extends Selenium calls to more appropriately handle testing errors, and supports testing over multiple browsers locally, or in the cloud in parallel. It can be a great starting point for building or improving test automation in your organization.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Coveros/selenified","created_at":"2017-06-08T19:48:17Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T14:10:14Z","pushed_at":"2020-03-09T00:05:47Z","homepage":"https://www.coveros.com/products/selenified/","size":9958,"stargazers_count":33,"watchers_count":33,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":true,"forks_count":9,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"open_issues_count":19,"license":{"key":"apache-2.0","name":"Apache License 2.0","spdx_id":"Apache-2.0","url":"https://api.github.com/licenses/apache-2.0","node_id":"MDc6TGljZW5zZTI="},"forks":9,"open_issues":19,"watchers":33,"default_branch":"develop","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"temp_clone_token":"","organization":{"login":"Coveros","id":4560791,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ1NjA3OTE=","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coveros","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"network_count":9,"subscribers_count":7}
