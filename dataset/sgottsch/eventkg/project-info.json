The EventKG is an extensible event-centric resource modeled in RDF. It relies on Open Data and best practices to make event data spread across different sources available through a common representation and reusable for a variety of novel algorithms and real-world applications.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sgottsch/eventkg","created_at":"2017-05-15T19:31:09Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T10:16:12Z","pushed_at":"2020-04-27T10:16:08Z","homepage":"http://eventkg.l3s.uni-hannover.de/","size":6293,"stargazers_count":20,"watchers_count":20,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"forks_count":6,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"open_issues_count":3,"forks":6,"open_issues":3,"watchers":20,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"temp_clone_token":"","network_count":6,"subscribers_count":3}
