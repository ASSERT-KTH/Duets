Memcached comes with multiple languages clients including java.  The client provides you an ability to gain access to the memcached servers and perform operations you need. All these operations a low level and require you to have control over synchronous/asynchronous execution of your request, require you to specify serializer to use, require you to manage data at low level.  As you know memcached is in-memory storage, if server crashes - data is lost. To avoid this kind of issues we write/read data from 2 identical memcached storages. Even if one crashes the other still able to server traffic and application do not see the problem. No outage for application.","fork":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/3levelmemcache","created_at":"2014-05-16T14:33:23Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T22:36:35Z","pushed_at":"2016-03-08T17:13:21Z","size":805,"stargazers_count":8,"watchers_count":8,"language":"Java","has_issues":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"forks_count":3,"archived":false,"disabled":false,"open_issues_count":0,"license":{"key":"bsd-3-clause","name":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License","spdx_id":"BSD-3-Clause","url":"https://api.github.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause","node_id":"MDc6TGljZW5zZTU="},"forks":3,"open_issues":0,"watchers":8,"default_branch":"master","permissions":{"admin":false,"push":false,"pull":true},"temp_clone_token":"","organization":{"login":"forcedotcom","id":464563,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2NDU2Mw==","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcedotcom","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"network_count":3,"subscribers_count":10}
